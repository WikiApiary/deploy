A section like the following one needs to be added to /etc/apache2/envvars

~~~~~~~~~~ SNIP ~~~~~~~~~~
. /etc/environment
~~~~~~~~~~ SNIP ~~~~~~~~~~

Then, add the following to the /etc/environment file so that this these settings are added to
people's environents when they log in. Since this contains secrets, this is not stored in the
(public) git repository.

~~~~~~~~~~ SNIP ~~~~~~~~~~
# Environment variables for WikiApiary
export WA_DBPASSWORD=xxx
export WA_SECRETKEY=xxx
export WA_UPGRADEKEY=xxx
export WA_EXTDATADBPASSWORD=xxx
~~~~~~~~~~ SNIP ~~~~~~~~~~

Note that /etc/environment is loaded by pam_env.so which needs to be installed.
